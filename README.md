## Building a resume with d3.js
Here's a template for a resume using [d3.js](http:///www.d3js.org) and [Bootstrap](getbootstrap.com/). Icons from [Socicon](http://www.socicon.com/) and [Glyphicons](http://glyphicons.com/).

Should be pretty responsive already thanks to Bootstap but needs some attention. Comments are welcome!

See a working example [here](http://cv.martisak.se).
